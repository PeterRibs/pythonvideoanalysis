# Video Analysis

In the field, I recorded the dance of a specie named Swallow-tailed Manakin. With each dance, we produced a script in Python to track the individuals in the flights and to extract their position. This script scans and tracks pixels based on color, which we set as “red” (150, 100, 100) as a reference for males' heads.
